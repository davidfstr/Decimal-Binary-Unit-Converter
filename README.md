# Decimal-Binary Unit Converter 1.0

Need to convert between decimal and binary byte units?<br/>
This is a unit converter make just for that purpose.

Different units for bytes are used in different places:

* File sizes (binary megabytes = MiB)
* Internet bandwidth (decimal megabits = Mbit)
* Hard drive sizes (decimal gigabytes = GB)
* RAM sizes (binary gigabytes = GiB)

This program helps you convert these units easily.
